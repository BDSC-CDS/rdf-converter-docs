Run scenario flowchart
=======================

The following flowchart can hopefully help you understand which converter and recipe you need to run.
If running from the source files, simply follow the equivalences described in the :ref:`Run ontology conversion <run_ontology>` and :ref:`Run data samples conversion <run_data>` sections (a quick study of the content of the Makefile recipes might help you).


The flowchart does not include:

* Folder structure configuration
* Editing of the configuration files
* Modifying of the environment variables

                                **Start on blue!**
